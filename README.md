## 🎯 What This Project Does

- Automatically finds and labels objects in images
- Highlights detected objects with boxes and names
- Shows count of each object as a chart
- Works for common things: people, cars, pets, and more

***

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Easy Upload** - Supports JPG and PNG images
- **Fast Results** - Detects in seconds thanks to YOLOv8
- **Clean UI** - Custom background, two-column layout
- **Bar Chart** - Displays how many of each object found
- **Demo Option** - Try with sample image included

***

## 🧐 How It Works

1. **Upload your image** or use the demo provided
2. The AI model scans and marks every object found
3. Detected objects are listed and counted in a chart
4. See the processed image and the chart side by side

***

## 🏗️ Technologies Used

- **Python** - Programming language
- **Streamlit** - Simple UI \& fast deployment
- **YOLOv8** - State-of-the-art object detection
- **OpenCV** - Image reading and processing
- **Pandas** - Data table and chart
